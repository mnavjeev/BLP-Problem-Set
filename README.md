In this repository is my code for John Asker's first problem set in the second year PhD Industrial Organization course. Probably the most useful thing here is the code to run the BLP portion of the problem set, blp2.py.

The code I have for blp2.py makes some (light) use of parallel processing when doing the numerical integration. In order to fully make use of this, make sure to change variable "cores_to_use" at the top of blp2.py to the number of cores you would want to allow the script to use. Using a lot of cores slows the computer down significantly, so I would suggest leaving at least 2 cores open at any time. When I was running BLP, I left the script running overnight and used 6/8 cores.

There are two ways given in the code to solve BLP, via grid search or via gradient descent. Instructions on how to run each one are given at the bottom of the code. For now, grid search is commented out so that if you just run this code without making any adjustments (past specifying the number of cores), it will do a gradient descent starting at an initial guess value of sigmaB = sigmaI = 0.1. I think computationally this is a much faster way of running the code, though you should still allow it to run overnight. If you want to do grid search, I would reccomend giving the code at least 2 days to run to get any sort of believable results.
